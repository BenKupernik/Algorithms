    "This algorithm runs in $\\Theta\\ (n)$ time and has three regions controlled by two for loops. The first for loop is bounded by index 0 to I and is the negative region. The second is bounded by index I + 1 to h and is the positive region. The third region is bounded by h + 1 to the length of the list. Once the bounds of either the positive or negative regions equal the length of the list both loops exit. Because they I and h variables can only grow by increasing the sorted area of this list and because the loops only exit when the sorted area equals the entire list the loop invariants guarantee the result were looking for. And because the first two loops will never look at the same value twice, they run in $\\Theta\\ (n)$ time as does the third. So, the overall time is $\\Theta\\ (n)$. On a side note I’m pretty sure there’s a smarter way to find the pivot than looking through the entire list but I keep getting an off by one error when I try it and this technically doesn’t increase the asymptotic running time so I’m going to be lazy and make math work for me for once."
